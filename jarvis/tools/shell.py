"""
Crossâ€‘platform shell execution utility for Jarvis.

This module attempts to run commands using the most appropriate shell available
on the host system. On Windows it prefers PowerShell (pwsh or powershell),
while on POSIX systems it falls back to bash or sh. It returns a dictionary
with the execution status, captured stdout/stderr, and return code.
